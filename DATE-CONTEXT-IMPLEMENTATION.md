Added current date awareness to both outline generation functions so the AI model knows the current month, day, and year.

**Deployed**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Live in Production

## 💡 Why This Matters

### Problems Solved

❌ **Before**:
- AI doesn't know current date
- May reference outdated trends or tools
- Can't make timely analogies
- Might suggest seasonal content at wrong time

✅ **After**:
- AI is aware of exact current date
- Avoids outdated information
- Makes relevant, timely analogies
- Understands seasonality and trends

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Date Format

```typescript
const currentDate = new Date();
const formattedDate = currentDate.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { 
  weekday: 'long', 
  year: 'numeric', 
  month: 'long', 
  day: 'numeric' 
});
// Output: "Monday, October 21, 2025"
```

### Fast-Outline-Search

**Added to prompt** (lines 195-205):
```typescript
const prompt = `**CURRENT DATE**: ${formattedDate}
**IMPORTANT**: Ensure all search results and information are current and relevant as of this date. Avoid outdated information or references.

Use web search to find the top 10 authoritative articles about "${jobDetails.post_keyword}".
...`
```

### Fast-Analyze-Outline-Content

**Added to prompt** (lines 270-280):
```typescript
const prompt = `**CURRENT DATE**: ${formattedDate}
**IMPORTANT**: Ensure the outline structure and topic selection reflect current trends and information as of this date. Avoid outdated approaches or time-sensitive content that may no longer be relevant.

You are creating a content outline for a brand article...`

**After** (With date context):
- AI prioritizes truly recent data from search results
- Avoids citing stale statistics

### Example 4: Cultural References

**Before** (No date context):

## 🧪 Testing

### How to Verify

Generate outlines for these types of content and check for date awareness:

format: { 
  weekday: 'long',    // "Monday"
  year: 'numeric',    // "2025"
  month: 'long',      // "October"
  day: 'numeric'      // "21"
